## Prologue
Welcome to my college journal. Here, you will see all the stuff I did during college.
## 1st Year
### 1st Sem
#### Midterms
The lectures were too slow for me so I added going to gym as a part of my routine.
#### Finals
I have learned php.
### 2nd Sem
#### Midterms
I learned connecting Java to MySQL, and use JFrame as the GUI. I joined an organization for experience.
#### Finals
College is starting to get a little too easy for me.. I rely on my own bot (xyReviewer) for the lectures. I do activities ASAP so they don't pile up, I take care of my mental health. Currently, I'm playing video games to pass the time.
## 2nd Year
### 1st Sem
I self-studied C/C++
### 2nd Sem
I developed QORA.
