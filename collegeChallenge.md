## Prologue
I started a challenge to attain Magna Cum Laude. If I'm not able to make it, at least I tried.
## 1st Year
### 1st Sem
#### Midterms
The lectures were too slow for me so I added going to gym as a part of my routine.
#### Finals
I have learned php.
### 2nd Sem
#### Midterms
I learned connecting Java to MySQL, and use JFrame as the GUI. I joined an organization for experience.
#### Finals
College is starting to get a little too easy for me.. I rely on my own bot (xyReviewer) for the lectures. I do activities ASAP so they don't pile up, I take care of my mental health. Currently, I'm playing video games to pass the time.
## Epilogue
Unfortunately, something went wrong around 2nd sem in midterms, 1st Year. I don't blame anyone but I failed the challenge because I trusted a wrong leader. Nonetheless, it was an awesome experience for 7 months!
