## Prologue:
I got a bad internship so I decided to come up with this challenge for months. It will help me to be occupied, learn, and improve despite my situation.

I'll change prologue once a I got a better internship, however, it's not guaranteed I'll get one. So, this is my plan for the mean time.
## Status
Doing all free and newbie challenges: 2/19
## Epilogue
Because of God's grace, I found a new better internship. So, I will be postponing this challenge for the mean time.

To God Be All The Glory.
