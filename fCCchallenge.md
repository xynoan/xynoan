## Prologue:
Before 18, I had all the time to slack off. Just watching anime, playing games, literally. I have done all unproductive activities you can imagine. Just kidding, it's a hyperbole, but I'm sure you
got the idea.
<br><br>
This year (2022), I'm graduating senior high school. Applying to college has been really tough. My
grades are not that good since I don't really like school. And most of colleges have high standards
with regards to that.
<br><br>
In other words, as of right now, 2022, my future is blurry. Just like what they say, you only
realize it when it's too late.<br><br>
But.. I don't think it's too late, though. As long as you don't lose hope.
<br><br>
I remember solving rubiks cube in the past, and it has a relevance when it comes to algorithms.
<br><br>
So.. Why not, try programming? I have been self-studying web development even before COVID, to be honest. But I wasn't motivated in investing most of my time on it.
<br><br>
But now, I do. Hence, I decided to do this challenge, for my future, and for myself.
<br><br>
Nothing will stop me now.

## Responsive Web Design
Oh my.. This was a really fun course. I'm not even joking. It was really fun and easy to understand it just took me 2 weeks to get the certification.
<br><br>
Ego aside, I'm far from good when it comes to designing websites, though.

## JavaScript Algorithms and Data Structures
This course was fun, but definitely not the same ride as RWD. 
<br>

_I struggled_.
<br>

I know myself enough that whenever [I open up something on the internet](https://forum.freecodecamp.org/t/javascript-entering-my-life/503141?u=xynoan), it means whatever it is that I'm doing is definitely not easy.<br>

Not easy to understand, but _not impossible_.

## Front End Development Libraries
Almost all section went smoothly, but I skipped Redux. I didn't _like_ it. I got an information from a senior on the industry that it's rarely used, so that's enough information to not push myself.
<br>

All section but.. the projects section.
<br>

From here onwards the **Drum Machine Project**, I'm expecting to learn _a lot_ on the following projects.
<br>

Like how I struggled, got depressed, got anxious, got imposter syndrome, I never gave up and I finally got control of JavaScript. Let's do the same on this course.

## Data Visualization
I'm gonna be honest. I was not so excited getting into this more than I was excited getting to the server-side (backend).

The lectures are decent, but the required projects... They didn't teach most of the knowledge we needed to accomplish those. But I still got through it so.. that's that, lol. Well, barely.

One thing for sure, I got the grasp of fetching API's... So that's really good.

## Back End Development and APIs
New knowledge, new knowledge... It's so annoying when you're doing a challenge and no idea (at all) is coming to mind. It felt like I was learning JavaScript again (lol).

After getting through the lectures section, specially Mongoose, there was a challenge that required a method that was already deprecated from the latest version and I lacked knowledge on downgrading a package, so that's that.

The projects were sooooooooooooo fun! I love solving these!

## Quality Assurance
Going through the testing library section was a breeze, going through Advanced Node and Express, I learned nothing if I didn't watch how Florin Pop go through that section. The explanations were vague, the errors were vage.

The projects, however, I was not able to complete. Unfortunately, I was hit by something that made me very unmotivated to continue for some reason.

## Epilogue
I learned a lot. Really. 4 months was a breeze and I got nothing to do in those months, so I appreciate freeCodeCamp for being there. I'm not sure if I'm gonna do something like this again (I figured I still don't understand the way I decide stuff), but it was definitely a fun ride and the lessons will benefit me for a lifetime. I'm planning to focus on solving katas in CodeWars for fun to keep my brain busy, somehow.
