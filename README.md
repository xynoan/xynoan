## Projects
Here are some of my significant projects:
### Personal
- [xyAgenda](https://codepen.io/Xynoan/full/qByNrRY)
I use this to keep track of my school schedule.
- [Markdown Previewer](https://codepen.io/Xynoan/full/QWQGPEv)
This is a project from freeCodeCamp. I use it to preview markdowns I write (like this bio)
- [xyReviewer](https://replit.com/@xynoan/xyReviewer)
I use this to review whenever exams are coming. It has `xy!review` command that sends you reviewer and `xy!start` will start a mock-quiz.
