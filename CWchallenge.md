## Context:
I plan to use CodeWars for improving my logical thinking and algorithm skills on any certain coding language I choose.
## Status:
JavaScript - 5 kyu
<br><br>
I'm quitting CodeWars. It definitely helped me develop my logical thinking and algorithm skills. But I personally think relying on this for <em>too long</em> is unhealthy: non-reasonable logic, some problems are irrelevant in the real world.
