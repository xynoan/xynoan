## Prologue
I want to re-live my desire to earn my money again as a teenager. I earn passive income as a teenager, as an adult but in a very short span. On this challenge, I want to fail as many job interviews in any company. My objective is to learn as much as possible and it would be funny if I accidentally got accepted in a job during the challenge. Lol. For that matter, I'm targeting part-time jobs only to be safe.
